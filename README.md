# DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline with Docker

End-to-end DevSecOps laboratory project implementing a complete CI/CD pipeline
with automated security controls integrated into each stage of the software lifecycle.

## 🔐 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to integrate security practices into a DevOps
workflow using the DevSecOps methodology. The pipeline automates testing,
building, security scanning and deployment of a vulnerable Node.js application.

The environment was deployed using Docker and Docker Compose and executed
originally on a cloud-based virtual machine (Azure).

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Docker & Docker Compose
- GitLab CE & GitLab Runner
- SonarQube (SAST)
- Trivy (SCA)
- OWASP ZAP (DAST)
- Node.js

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Stages
- **Test**: Dependency installation and basic application tests
- **Build**: Docker image creation
- **SAST**: Static code analysis using SonarQube
- **SCA**: Dependency and filesystem vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- **DAST**: Dynamic security testing using OWASP ZAP
- **Deploy**: Containerized application deployment for testing
